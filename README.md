## Depositor bot description
Depositor bot - Deposits buffered ether via depositBufferedEther call on "DepositSecurityModule" smart contract using special gas strategy.

The strategy is to check two things: how much buffered ether on smart contract are and gas fee.

We deposit when all the following points are correct:
- We received council signatures enough for quorum.
- Gas fee is lower or equal than 5-th percentile for past day.
- Buffered ETH is greater than or equal to the calculation according to a special formula depending on the gas fee.

## Pauser bot
If one of the councils send pause message (means something very bad going on), pauser bot try to send tx that will pause protocol.  
In addition, the council daemon tries to pause the protocol on its own.


## How to install

Python packages
```bash
git clone git@github.com:lidofinance/depositor-bot.git
cd depositor-bot
poetry install
```

## Run script

## Release flow

To create a new release:

1. Merge all changes to the `main` branch.
1. After the merge, the `Prepare release draft` action will run automatically. When the action is complete, a release draft is created.
1. When you need to release, go to Repo → Releases.
1. Publish the desired release draft manually by clicking the edit button - this release is now the `Latest Published`.
1. After publication, the action to create a release bump will be triggered automatically.
